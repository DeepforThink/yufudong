Hi！我是来自南开大学智能科学与技术专业的一名本科生，目前对强化学习，具身智能感兴趣。梦想是造出像人一样智能机器人！

平时闲暇我很喜欢弹吉他（但现在有点小菜），各种各样的体育活动（篮球，排球，羽毛球，乒乓球。。。。。。目前还是健身小白）。我也喜欢广交朋友，feel free to contact with me!

I am an undergraduate student majoring in Intelligent Science and Technology at Nankai University. Currently, I am interested in reinforcement learning and embodied intelligence. My dream is to build an intelligent robot that is as intelligent as a human! 

In my spare time, I really like playing the guitar (although I'm still a bit of a beginner at the moment), and I also enjoy various sports activities (basketball, volleyball, badminton, table tennis... I'm still a novice in fitness). I also like making friends widely. Feel free to contact me!
